Directions

# Bring water to a boil
# Meanwhile make the meatballs. Mix the pork, tablespoon of sugar, black pepper, soy sauce, minced garlic, and salt. Form small meatballs.
# When the water boils, pour over the noodles and let sit about 20 minutes.
# Brown the meatballs in a hot frying pan. When they are fully browned, remove from the pan. Don't clean out the pan. In the same pan, add the 2 tablespoons of sugar and 1/4 cup of water. Stir to dissolve, then allow it to cook on high without stirring until it becomes very browned and bubbly. This is caramel. Add the final cup of water and stir to combine. Return the meatballs to the pan and cook in the caramel sauce for 15 minutes.
# For the Dressing, prepare the lemongrass. Remove the stringy woody layers until you get the tender center. Chop the lemongrass into small pieces. Chop the chiles into thin rounds. Bring the water to a simmer and add the lemongrass sugar and chiles. Let this sit for 15 minutes. Finally, add the fish sauce.
# Strain and rinse the noodles. Chop the peanuts, mint, cucumber, scallions and lettuce. Grate the carrots with a box grater.
# Place the noodles in the bowl first, arrange the rest of the ingredients around the noodles in the bowl.
# Serve with the sauce on the side and lots of sriracha!
