Here, sautéed polenta triangles add another dimension to a southwestern-style stew.

Stew:
-----

2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups finely chopped onions
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 pounds red-skinned sweet potatoes (yams; about 2 medium), peeled, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
2 cups orange juice
2 tablespoons minced garlic

2 15- to 16-ounce cans black beans, rinsed, drained
2 poblano chilies, seeded, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped

Sour cream (optional)
Avocado slices (optional)
Orange wedges (optional)

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until tender, about 10 minutes. Add ginger, chili powder and cumin and stir 2 minutes. Add sweet potatoes, orange juice and garlic and bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until sweet potatoes are almost tender, about 10 minutes.
Stir beans, poblano chilies and bell pepper into sweet potato mixture. Cover and simmer until chilies are tender, about 15 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over low heat before continuing, stirring occasionally.)
Divide stew among 4 bowls. Top with sour cream, avocado and orange, if desired. Serve with Polenta Triangles.

Polenta:
--------
yield: Makes 12

2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup yellow cornmeal
3 tablespoons (about) olive oil

Oil large baking sheet. Bring 2 cups water and salt to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Gradually whisk in cornmeal. Reduce heat to medium. Stir constantly with wooden spoon until mixture is very thick, about 6 minutes.
Divide hot polenta into 2 equal mounds on prepared baking sheet. Using back of spoon, flatten each mound into 6-inch circle, about 1/2 inch thick. Let stand until cool. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover with plastic and refrigerate.)
Cut each polenta circle into 6 wedges. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add polenta to skillet; cook until slightly crisp at edges and heated through, adding more oil to skillet as necessary, about 3 minutes per side. Serve warm.
