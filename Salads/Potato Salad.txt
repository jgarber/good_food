Grandma Garber's Potato Salad
revised by Mom

5lb potatoes (red is better)
6 hard-boiled eggs
2c Miracle-whip
1/2c milk (but usually takes more like 3/4)
1/2t mustard (1 1/2 is better-Mom)
2T vinegar
2t salt
1/2 onion chopped fine (to taste)
pickles or sweet relish to taste

Boil whole potatoes until fork slides easily in and out.  Cool 1 hour, peel, and cube. Mix ingredients except potatoes, egg, and onions in a bowl.  Layer half potatoes, half eggs, and half dressing and gently stir.  Don't stir much!  Then the rest and gently stir in.  Add more milk if needed.  A little soupy is OK 'cause it will absorb.
